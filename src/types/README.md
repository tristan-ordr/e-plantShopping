# Generated Types Files:

The file `/src/types/generated/schema.ts` is generated. Do not edit it directly.

Instead, to make changes to the graphql types, edit the schema.graphql file on the server.

Then, run `npm run codegen` from the root directory of the server 
to generate the server-side type files.

Then, run `npm run codegen` from the root directory of this project (the client)
to generate the client-side type files. This will replace `/src/types/generated/schema.ts`
with your up-to-date type definitions.
